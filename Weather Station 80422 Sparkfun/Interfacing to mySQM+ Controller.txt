RJ11 Sockets

Station RJ11
1 GND										: J11:GND
2 Anemometer pin 1 - wire to Digital IO pin and 1M pulldown to GND 		: J11:SIG
3 Anemometer pin 2 - wire to 3.3V						: J11:3V3	
4 Wind direction (0-4.78V) - wire to Digital IO Pin and 10K pullup to 3.3V	: J12:SIG

Rain Gauge RJ11
1 NC
2 Wire to Digital IO pin and 1M pulldown to GND					: J18:SIG
3 Wire to 3.3V									: J18:3V3
4 NC

Note1:
Anemometer is interrupt driven. Rising pulse on DIO pin.
Support already in ESP32 for this.
Granularity = 1.492mph (2.4km/h) for 1 interrupt per second.
This requires an interrupt timer to handle interrupts from the sensor.
Another 1s interrupt timer is required to do the calculation.
Any value is 1.492mph * number of interrupts per second

// To enable the windspeed sensor uncomment the next line
#define WINDSPEEDSENSOR 1

// To enable the Anemometer Weather Meters Kit by Sparkfun Electronics 
// SEN-08942 [see PDF] Pulse sensor Output also uncomment the next line
#define ANEMOMETER80422 7


Note 2:
Wind direction is a simple resistor divider.
Can be measured at any time.
Does not require interrupts.
Input will be a Digital Pin.
Support already in code for this.
Values already converted in code to handle 3.3V
Output of sensor should go through simple 1.1K/2.2K resistor divider to get to 3.3V max

// To enable the Wind Direction sensor uncomment the next line
#define WINDDIRECTIONSENSOR 1

// To enable the 8 directional Analog Wind Direction sensor uncomment the next line
#define ANALOGDIRECTIONSENSOR 2


Note 3:
Rain Gauge currently not supported
0.011" of rain issues 1 interrupt
Requires interrupt pin. Rising pulse on DIO pin.
This could be tied to use of 1s timer (divided by 60) to count rain per minute
Would require 3.3V on one wire to gauge
Would require pulldown 1M to GND on other wire to gauge - which goes to input pin of sensor

Recommend using separate myESP32 Daughter board to do the measurements
myESP32 DB runs in Station mode
Recommend using JSON support to get data from myESP32 DB into other devices like Controller

Both Controller and myESP32 Daughter board would be Station Mode

Alternative:
Add Rain Gauge support into myESP32 Controller
Support already there for Anemometer and Wind Direction
Only need to find new pin to be used and write code
